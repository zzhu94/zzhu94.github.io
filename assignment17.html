Large average donations cannot help McCrory overcome Cooper’s total donations
 As the heavily contested North Carolina Governor’s race nears its end, third-quarter campaign donation data provided by the N.C. State Board of Elections reveals notable trends in both in-state and out of state donations. 
 	In the recent quarter, Democratic challenger, Attorney General Roy Cooper led incumbent Governor Pat McCrory in total campaign donations. Cooper tallied a sum of over 9 million while McCrory recorded donations at around 5.3 million. Cooper also had recorded a lot more separate donations than McCrory. Cooper’s 9 million in campaign donations was received from around 32,000 recorded donations while McCrory’s 5.3 million was received from around 15,000 recorded donations. In this tight governor’s race, Cooper has received around 1.7 times the amount of money as McCrory has. As with most races, incumbents are generally seen as having an advantage over challengers, which may explain the disparity in campaign donations. Democrats are mailing in donations with the goal of reclaiming the North Carolina governor’s office. 
	When looking at campaign donation information for each candidate, out of state donations catch the eye. Cooper leads McCrory in total out of state donations. Cooper has around 750 thousand in out of state donations while McCrory has around 600 thousand in out of state donations. These donations make up around 8 percent of Cooper’s total donation amount and around 11 percent of McCrory’s total donation amount. Though Cooper still leads in out of state donations, the amounts are much closer with Cooper only having around 1.25 times the amount of donation money compared to McCrory. This is a much closer than the 1.7 times advantage that Cooper holds in total campaign donations. Large donations for McCrory help lessen the advantage that Cooper has out of state. 
Despite Cooper having way more individual donation from out of state, receiving 2,244 donations compared to McCrory’s 443, McCrory received a much larger amount per donation than Cooper. McCrory received an average out of state donation of about 1,365 dollars while Cooper’s average out of state donation was only around 335 dollars. McCrory’s average out of state donation was around 4 times the amount of Cooper’s average out of state donations. This huge disparity helped McCrory mitigate Cooper’s out of state advantage. 
	As with all campaign reports, there are often anonymous donations that given to each candidate. These donations don’t have any personal information such as name or state attached to them and are named aggregated individual contributions when reported to the campaign finance committee. It is also not possible to track the total lifetime donation amounts of these donors. These contributions are all under 50 dollars and make up a good portion of each candidate’s total number of contributions.  
	But how sufficient are these aggregated individual contributions? In terms of total number of donations, around 8500 out of Cooper’s total donations are aggregated individual contributions. This is slightly over one fourth of Cooper’s total donations. Meanwhile, McCrory has around 4000 aggregated individual contributions. As with Cooper, McCrory’s aggregated individual contributions account for slightly over one fourth of his total donations. However, the total amount donated from these donations aren’t nearly as impressive as their quantity. Cooper and McCrory both get around 25 dollars from each of their anonymous contributions. This amounts to around 215 thousand dollars for Cooper and around 102 thousand dollars for McCrory. Cooper’s campaign donations from aggregated individual contributors makes up only 2.4 percent of Cooper’s total donation amount and McCrory’s only make up around 1.9 percent of his total donation amount. Neither Cooper nor McCrory depend on these small anonymous donations s their main source of campaign funding. 
	In North Carolina, donors who give over 50 dollars must be identified. This leads to the large quantity of non-identified contributors to be almost nominal compared to the identified donors. Identified donors may donate as much as 5100 dollars, substantially more than what unidentified contributors donate. 
	There are, of course, ways around the 5,100 dollar limit set for individuals. Groups and committees are allowed to give way more money to candidates than the amount individuals can give. The candidates’ parties are perhaps the most notable example of this. Cooper received 1 million dollars from the North Carolina Democratic Party. McCrory also received 450,000 dollars from the North Carolina Republican Party. Both candidates benefited from large donations over 5,100 dollars with Cooper receiving around 3.5 million dollars and McCrory receiving around 1.4 million dollars. Cooper definitely gained an edge through this donation method receiving around 2.5 times the amount that McCrory got. This method is where Cooper gained a decisive advantage in campaign donations as his 2.5:1 advantage donations over 5,100 dollars is far greater than the 1.7:1 that he has in total donations. 
	Overall, the average donation amounts definitely favored McCrory over Cooper. McCrory received an average of 353 dollars across his 15,000 total donations. Cooper on the other hand received around 281 dollars per donation. McCrory’s average donation was about 25 percent more on average than Cooper’s donations. 
	Looking through the third quarter numbers, it is easy to see that Cooper has a decided advantage when it comes to campaign donations. However, it’s interesting to consider that McCrory’s donations on average are higher amounts to McCrory than Cooper’s donors. McCrory’s out of state donations, on average, donate around 4 times the amount that Cooper’s out of state donors. Despite these McCrory having larger donations, on average, Cooper’s total donor count is too much for McCrory to overcome. This paired with massive committee donations have helped Cooper establish a huge lead in total donations in the third quarter.
