<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Large average
donations cannot help McCrory overcome Cooper’s total donations</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'> As the heavily contested North
Carolina Governor’s race nears its end, third-quarter campaign donation data
provided by the N.C. State Board of Elections reveals notable trends in both
in-state and out of state donations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In the recent quarter, Democratic
challenger, Attorney General Roy Cooper led incumbent Governor Pat McCrory in
total campaign donations. Cooper tallied a sum of over 9 million while McCrory
recorded donations at around 5.3 million. Cooper also had recorded a lot more
separate donations than McCrory. Cooper’s 9 million in campaign donations was
received from around 32,000 recorded donations while McCrory’s 5.3 million was
received from around 15,000 recorded donations. In this tight governor’s race,
Cooper has received around 1.7 times the amount of money as McCrory has. As
with most races, incumbents are generally seen as having an advantage over
challengers, which may explain the disparity in campaign donations. Democrats
are mailing in donations with the goal of reclaiming the North Carolina governor’s
office. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When looking at campaign donation
information for each candidate, out of state donations catch the eye. Cooper
leads McCrory in total out of state donations. Cooper has around 750 thousand
in out of state donations while McCrory has around 600 thousand in out of state
donations. These donations make up around 8 percent of Cooper’s total donation
amount and around 11 percent of McCrory’s total donation amount. Though Cooper
still leads in out of state donations, the amounts are much closer with Cooper
only having around 1.25 times the amount of donation money compared to McCrory.
This is a much closer than the 1.7:1 advantage that Cooper holds in total
campaign donations. Large donations for McCrory help lessen the advantage that
Cooper has out of state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Despite Cooper having way more
individual donation from out of state, receiving 2,244 donations compared to
McCrory’s 443, McCrory received a much larger amount per donation than Cooper.
McCrory received an average out of state donation of about 1,365 dollars while
Cooper’s average out of state donation was only around 335 dollars. McCrory’s
average out of state donation was around 4 times the amount of Cooper’s average
out of state donations. This huge disparity helped McCrory mitigate Cooper’s
out of state advantage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As with all campaign reports, there are often
anonymous donations that given to each candidate. These donations don’t have
any personal information such as name or state attached to them and are named
aggregated individual contributions when reported to the campaign finance
committee. It is also not possible to track the total lifetime donation amounts
of these donors. These contributions are all under 50 dollars and make up a
good portion of each candidate’s total number of contributions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But how sufficient are these aggregated
individual contributions? In terms of total number of donations, around 8,500
out of Cooper’s total donations are aggregated individual contributions. This
is slightly over one fourth of Cooper’s total donations. Meanwhile, McCrory has
around 4,000 aggregated individual contributions. As with Cooper, McCrory’s
aggregated individual contributions account for slightly over one fourth of his
total donations. However, the total amount donated from these donations aren’t
nearly as impressive as their quantity. Cooper and McCrory both get around 25
dollars from each of their anonymous contributions. This amounts to around 215
thousand dollars for Cooper and around 102 thousand dollars for McCrory.
Cooper’s campaign donations from aggregated individual contributors makes up
only 2.4 percent of Cooper’s total donation amount and McCrory’s only make up
around 1.9 percent of his total donation amount. Neither Cooper nor McCrory
depend on these small anonymous donations s their main source of campaign
funding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In North Carolina, donors who give over 50
dollars must be identified. This leads to the large quantity of non-identified
contributors to be almost nominal compared to the identified donors. Identified
donors may donate as much as 5100 dollars, substantially more than what
unidentified contributors donate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                There are, of course, ways around the 5,100
dollar limit set for individuals. Groups and committees are allowed to give way
more money to candidates than the amount individuals can give. The candidates’
parties are perhaps the most notable example of this. Cooper received 1 million
dollars from the North Carolina Democratic Party. McCrory also received 450,000
dollars from the North Carolina Republican Party. Both candidates benefited
from large donations over 5,100 dollars with Cooper receiving around 3.5
million dollars and McCrory receiving around 1.4 million dollars. Cooper
definitely gained an edge through this donation method receiving around 2.5
times the amount that McCrory got. This method is where Cooper gained a
decisive advantage in campaign donations as his 2.5:1 advantage donations over
5,100 dollars is far greater than the 1.7:1 that he has in total donations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Overall, the average donation amounts
definitely favored McCrory over Cooper. McCrory received an average of 353
dollars across his 15,000 total donations. Cooper on the other hand received
around 281 dollars per donation. McCrory’s average donation was about 25
percent more on average than Cooper’s donations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Looking through the third quarter numbers,
it is easy to see that Cooper has a decided advantage when it comes to campaign
donations. However, it’s interesting to consider that McCrory’s donations on
average are higher amounts to McCrory than Cooper’s donors. McCrory’s out of
state donations, on average, donate around 4 times the amount that Cooper’s out
of state donors. Despite these McCrory having larger donations, on average,
Cooper’s total donor count is too much for McCrory to overcome. This paired
with massive committee donations have helped Cooper establish a huge lead in
total donations in the third quarter.    </p>
